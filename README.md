# Website-Blocker

Another project in python where I created a background running progam for windows (compatible with Linux and Mac with a little change in the code) that will allow you to block some websites for a choosen time schedule.

I personnally use it everyday of my life to force me not to go to social medias during productive hours

To use :
  run a command promt with administrator rights or sudo and python website_blocker.pyw
  You might want to use a Task Scheduler to make you machine do it by itself everytime it starts.
